        <p class="discordtos">On April 15, 2024, Discord's revised Terms of Service came into force, introducing significant updates. Notably, Discord has incorporated an arbitration clause, thereby precluding users from pursuing litigation against the platform in case of grievances or harm inflicted. Discord’s mandatory arbitration provision restricts users from suing the company in court, forcing them into an arbitration process that heavily favors corporations. This limits users’ ability to seek justice through traditional legal channels. Discord’s arbitration clause serves to protect the company’s interests by limiting potential liabilities and legal challenges, emphasizing the need for users to be informed and proactive in safeguarding their rights within the platform.</p>
        <p class="discordtos2">In addition, although Discord does not monitize the data it collects it still shares it with third-parties, "We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business purposes."</p>
        <p class="discordtos3">The Discord Trust and Safety Team has the ability to read any message you send. Although Discord ensure's they are trustworthy, who's to say they won't take a peek into your personal coversations.</p>
